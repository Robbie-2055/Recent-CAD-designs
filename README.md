# Hi there! I'm Roberto 👋
## Recent CAD Robotics & Mechanical Designs

I am a Mechatronics engineer focused on creating functional,
high-performance robotic systems. As i further explore the use of solidworks,  I thought i could present some of my recent CAD 
designs that i plan to bring to life to test different aspects like PID control in 
selfbalancing system and Kinematics and inverse kinematics in the robotic arm and the 
quadraped.
